# GarageManager
RAD Project App using JSF and Eclipse as development tools.

##Project overview
This is my project for JSF front ended web application that utilizes mySql database in the back end.
It was an assignment for RAD module in 1st semester of 3rd year software development  course. Project itself is a simple garage management
tool where user can add new manufacturers into the list, update them and/or delete them. Also there is option to add and delete new 
models and vehicles that garage deals with. There is a search page for existing vehicles in the database and a full details page that
displays all details existing in database about a selected vehicle.
